# docker-base

https://hub.docker.com/r/behance/docker-base/tags/

Provides base OS, security patches, and tools for quick and easy spinup.


### Variants

* Ubuntu 18.04 LTS available, tagged as `-VERSION#-ubuntu-18.04`
* Ubuntu 20.04 LTS available, tagged as `-VERSION#-ubuntu-20.04`
* Alpine builds available, tagged as `-alpine`
* Centos 7 builds available, tagged as `-centos-7`
* Centos 8 builds available, tagged as `-centos-8`


### Tools

* [S6](https://github.com/just-containers/s6-overlay) process supervisor is used for `only` for zombie reaping (as PID 1), boot coordination, and termination signal translation
* [Goss](https://github.com/aelsabbahy/goss) is used for build-time testing
* [Dgoss](https://github.com/aelsabbahy/goss/tree/master/extras/dgoss) is used for run-time testing.

### Expectations

To add a service to be monitored, simply create a service [run](https://github.com/just-containers/s6-overlay#writing-a-service-script) script
For programmatic switches, create the service in `/etc/services-available`, and symlink to `/etc/services.d` to enable

### Security

A convenience script is provided for security-only package updates.

On Ubuntu and CentOS-based variants, run:
```/bin/bash -e /security_updates.sh```

This file is actually a symlink to the variant-specific script contained in the `/scripts` folder

NOTE: for Alpine variant, which is security-conscious, but does not have a mechanism to isolate security-specific updates, use `apk update && apk upgrade` as a generic alternative.

### Packaging

A convenience script is provided for post-package installation cleanup

On all variants, run:
```/bin/bash -e /clean.sh```

This file, like security_updates (above) is actually a symlink to the variant-specific script contained in the `/scripts` folder


### Environment Variables

Variable | Example | Description
--- | --- | ---
S6_KILL_FINISH_MAXTIME | S6_KILL_FINISH_MAXTIME=55000 | The maximum time (in ms) a script in /etc/cont-finish.d could take before sending a KILL signal to it. Take into account that this parameter will be used per each script execution, it's not a max time for the whole set of scripts. This value has a max of 65535 on Alpine variants.
S6_KILL_GRACETIME | S6_KILL_GRACETIME=500 | Wait time (in ms) for S6 finish scripts before sending kill signal. This value has a max of 65535 on Alpine variants.

* `with-contenv` tool, which is used to expose environment variables across scripts, has a limitation that it cannot read beyond 4k characters for environment variable values. To work around this issue, use the script `/scripts/with-bigcontenv` instead of `with-contenv`. You'll need to remove the `with-contenv` from the shebang line, and add  `source /scripts/with-bigcontenv` in the next line after the shebang line.
### Startup/Runtime Modification

To inject changes just before runtime, shell scripts may be placed into the
`/etc/cont-init.d` folder.
As part of the process manager, these scripts are run in advance of the supervised processes. @see https://github.com/just-containers/s6-overlay#executing-initialization-andor-finalization-tasks

### Testing

- Container tests itself as part of build process using [goss](https://github.com/aelsabbahy/goss) validator. To add additional build-time tests, overwrite (or extend) the `./container/root/goss.base.yaml` file.
- To initiate run-time validation, please execute `test.sh`. It uses [dgoss](https://github.com/aelsabbahy/goss/tree/master/extras/dgoss) validator. To add additional run-time tests, extend `./test.sh` and `./goss.yaml` file.



### Advanced Modification

More advanced changes can take effect using the `run.d` system. Similar to the `/etc/cont-init.d/` script system, any shell scripts (ending in .sh) in the `/run.d/` folder will be executed ahead of the S6 initialization.

- If a `run.d` script terminates with a non-zero exit code, container will stop, terminating with the script's exit code, unless...
- If script terminates with exit code of $SIGNAL_BUILD_STOP (99), this will signal the container to stop cleanly. This can be used for a multi-stage build process


### Shutdown Behavior

#### Sequence of events for a crashed supervised service:

1. S6 [finish](https://github.com/just-containers/s6-overlay#writing-an-optional-finish-script) scripts are executed. The supervised service is presumed down at this point, its return code is a variable (`${1}`).
1. If no `finish` script is specified, service gets restarted, with no further action
1. If `finish` script specifies to bring the container down, admin-initiated container termination behavior applies (below).


#### Sequence of events for a `docker stop` or admin-initiated container termination:

1. SIGTERM is broadcast to all supervised services, described as a [run](https://github.com/just-containers/s6-overlay#writing-a-service-script) script. `S6_KILL_GRACETIME` corresponds with how long to wait for a SIGTERM to complete and return. This first signal can be trapped/intercepted to convert into a graceful stop (see below). Failure for the supervised service to respond to the signal within `S6_KILL_GRACETIME` will result in an untrappable SIGKILL.
1. Scripts in `/etc/cont-finish.d` are executed, each with `S6_KILL_FINISH_MAXTIME`.
1. S6 [finish](https://github.com/just-containers/s6-overlay#writing-an-optional-finish-script) scripts are executed. The supervised service is presumed down at this point, its return code is a variable (`${1}`).
1. Beyond this point, signals cannot be trapped or interrupted. All services should already be down by this point, or they will be forcibly brought down by the following signals.
1. SIGHUP is broadcast to all services, in all trees.
1. SIGTERM is broadcast to all services, in all trees.
1. SIGKILL terminates anything remaining

#### Implementing graceful shutdown from admin-initiated container termination

- Set `S6_KILL_FINISH_MAXTIME` long-enough to shutdown/drain service properly. See table above for upper limits.
- Trap SIGTERM in supervised service `run` script. Take no action directly at this time.
- Create a graceful shutdown script, place in `/etc/cont-finish.d` directory. Supervised service must terminate itself as a result, within `S6_KILL_FINISH_MAXTIME` time. Some examples include: sending alternate shutdown control signals (like SIGWINCH or SIGQUIT),


### Long-running processes (workers + crons)

This container image can be used with multiple entrypoints (not to be confused with Docker entrypoints).
For example, a codebase that runs a web service, but also requires crons and background workers. These processes should not run inside the same container (like a VM would), but can be executed separately from the same image artifact by adding arguments to the `run` command.

`docker run {image_id} /worker.sh 3 /bin/binary -parameters -that -binary -receives`

Runs `3` copies of `/bin/binary` that receives the parameters `-parameters -that -binary -receives`


### Container Organization

Besides the instructions contained in the Dockerfile, the majority of this
container's use is in configuration and process. The `./container/root` repo directory is overlayed into a container during build. Adding additional files to the folders in there will be present in the final image. All paths from the following explanation are assumed from the repo's `./root/` base:

Directory | Use
--- | ---
`/etc/cont-init.d/` | startup scripts that run ahead of services booting: https://github.com/just-containers/s6-overlay#executing-initialization-andor-finalization-tasks
`/etc/fix-attrs.d/` | scripts that may fix permissions at runtime: https://github.com/just-containers/s6-overlay#fixing-ownership--permissions
`/etc/services.d/` |  services that will be supervised by S6: https://github.com/just-containers/s6-overlay#writing-a-service-script
`/etc/services-available/` | same as above, but must be symlinked into `/etc/services.d/` to take effect
`/run.d/` | shell scripts (ending in .sh) that make runtime modifications ahead of S6 initialization
`/scripts` | convenience scripts that can be leveraged in derived images
